#mathIO - CHANGELOG
##Version 0.0.3.3 - ENTRY::5/02/2013
<b>CHANGES</b><br>
1. I've added a metric conversion function that will convert things like cm to m, or km to m.<br>
<b>NOTES:</b> It has not been tested yet and I need some one to test this for me, I'm working a lot so its gonna take me some time to get this tested, hopefuly you (the reader) forks this and tests it out.
