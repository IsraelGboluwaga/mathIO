mathIO
======

mathIO is a (npm module) libary of math algorithms and basic math functions.
When ever I learn a new subject or algorithm todo with Math I add it here. I'm allways learning so
you'll be able to see a lot of great stuff popup on math.IO.
It has some great functions you'll really want to use and functions that can save you some time.
