#mathIO

##Introduction

mathIO is a (npm module) libary of math algorithms and basic math functions.
When ever I learn a new subject or algorithm todo with Math I add it here. I'm allways learning so
you'll be able to see a lot of great stuff popup on math.IO.
It has some great functions you'll really want to use and functions that can save you some time.

##Install

mathIO does not currently require any external libs, and so if you want to install all you need to do is:

```bash
npm install mathio@0.0.2
```

##Use

Coming Soon. Check out examples.js for now ;D
