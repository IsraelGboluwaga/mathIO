##How to get started

To be honest right now I have no requirements as long as your pull request helps me out and I would love to see you add a joke or two in there :)

##What I need done

Here is my mathIO todo list:

1. Fix any bugs you find.
2. Add any algorithms you find.
3. Add mesurement (eg. imperial or metric) conversions (eg m to cm, km to m, yard to km, hectare to m, etc....).
4. Add mean, median and cumulative frequency related functions.
5. Anything else!
