#mathIO - Contributing

##How to get started

To be honest right now I have no requirements as long as your pull request helps me out and I would love to see you add a joke or two in there :)

##What I need done

Here is my mathIO todo list:

1. Fix any bugs you find.
2. Add any algorithms you find.
3. Add mean, median and cumulative frequency related functions.
4. Anything else!
